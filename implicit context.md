implicit context or side effect
---
> using functions and procedures with as few implicit contexts and side-effects as possible. A functionâ€™s implicit context is made up of any of the global variables or items in the persistence layer that are accessed from within the function. Side-effects are the changes that a function makes to its implicit context. If a function saves or deletes data in a global variable or in the persistence layer, it is said to have a side-effect.
