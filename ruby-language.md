Difference between exec, system and %x() or Backticks
---
The `system` method calls a system program. You have to provide the command as a string argument to this method.

The invoked program will use the current `STDIN`, `STDOUT` and `STDERR` objects of your Ruby program. In fact, the actual return value is either `true`, `false` or `nil`. In the example the date was printed through the IO object of STDIN. The method will return `true` if the process exited with a zero status, `false` if the process exited with a non-zero status and `nil` if the execution failed.

Another side effect is that the global variable `$?` is set to a `Process::Status` object. This object will contain information about the call itself, including the process identifier (PID) of the invoked process and the exit status.
```ruby
system("date")
system "rm test-rails-app"
system "ln -s #{test_app_path} test-rails-app"
```
`Backticks` (``) call a system program and return its output. The global variable `$?` is set through the backticks, too. With backticks you can also make use string interpolation.

Using `%x` is an alternative to the backticks style. It will return the output, too.

By using `Kernel#exec` the current process (your Ruby script) is replaced with the process invoked through exec. The method can take a string as argument. In this case the string will be subject to shell expansion. When using more than one argument, then the first one is used to execute a program and the following are provided as arguments to the program to be invoked.
