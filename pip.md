PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE
---
Added support for an environmental variable `$PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE` which will cache package downloads, so future installations wonâ€™t require large downloads. Network access is still required, but just some downloads will be avoided when using this.

To take advantage of this, I've added the following to my ~/.bash_profile:

`export PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE=$HOME/.pip_download_cache`
```shell
# install our common Python packages in a temporary virtual env so that they'll get cached
if [[ ! -e /home/vagrant/.pip_download_cache ]]; then
    su - vagrant -c "mkdir -p /home/vagrant/.pip_download_cache && \
        virtualenv /home/vagrant/yayforcaching && \
        PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE=/home/vagrant/.pip_download_cache /home/vagrant/yayforcaching/bin/pip install -r /vagrant_data/common_requirements.txt && \
        rm -rf /home/vagrant/yayforcaching"
fi
```
