feature branch
---
When starting work on a new feature, branch off from the develop branch.
```shell
git checkout -b myfeature develop
```
Finished features may be merged into the develop branch to definitely add them to the upcoming release.
> The `--no-ff` flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. 
This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.

```shell
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff myfeature
git branch -d myfeature # Deleted branch myfeature
git push origin develop
```
Creating a release branch
---
```shell
git checkout -b release-1.2 develop
./bump-version.sh 1.2 # version bumped to 1.2.
git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.2" 
```
Finishing a release branch
---
```shell
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release-1.2
git tag -a 1.2 # the -a option makes an unsigned, annotated tag object
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release-1.2
git branch -d release-1.2  # now the release may be deleted
```
git flow
---
After installing git-flow (`brew install git-flow`), you can start using git-flow in your repository by using it's `init` command. 
```shell
git flow init
```
> `git-flow` is just a wrapper around existing git commands, so the init command doesn't change anything in your repository other than creating branches for you.

> If you run git branch after setting up, you'll notice that you switched from the master branch to a new one named develop.

```shell
git flow feature start authentication
```
> Switched to a new branch 'feature/authentication'

```shell
git flow feature finish authentication
```
> Switched to branch 'develop'. 

> Summary of actions:
- The feature branch 'feature/authentication' was merged into 'develop'
- Feature branch 'feature/authentication' has been removed
- You are now on branch 'develop'
