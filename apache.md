Apache user and group
---
```shell
groupadd web-content
usermod -a -G web-content alice
usermod -a -G web-content apache
chown -R alice:web-content /var/www/html
find /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \;
find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 750 {} \;
```
What we've done here is to set all files to `rw-r-----` and directories to `rwxr-x---`. Because the group "web-content" is applied to all the files and directories, `httpd` can read these files, but cannot write to them.

> A common gotcha for directories hosted outside of the default /var/www/ is that the Apache user doesn't just need permissions to the directory and subdirectories where the site is being hosted. Apache requires permissions to all the directories all the way up to the root of the file system where the site is hosted. Apache automatically gets permissions assigned to /var/www/ when it's installed, so if your host directory is directly underneath that then this doesn't apply to you. Edit: Daybreaker has reported that his Apache was installed without correct access permissions to the default directory.

> For example, you've got a development machine and your site's directory is:
```
/username/home/Dropbox/myamazingsite/
```
You may think you can get away with:
```
chgrp -R www-data /username/home/Dropbox/myamazingsite/
chmod -R 2750 /username/home/Dropbox/myamazingsite/
```
because this gives Apache permissions to access your site's directory? Well that's correct but it's not sufficient. Apache requires permissions all the way up the directory tree so what you need to do is:
```
chgrp -R www-data /username/
chmod -R 2750 /username/
```
`Setgid` is pretty much the exact same as setuid, but the binary runs with the privileges of the owner group rather than the user’s primary group privileges.

> You might have selinux enabled. Try
`getenforce`
If it shows "Enforcing", try
`setenforce 0`
should fix your issue

This configuration allows you to use the URL `http://client1.dev` on your local machine with your site files stored in `/www/sites/client1/wwwroot`. It also allows you to use the service xip.io to use the URL `http://client1.[LOCAL IP].xip.io` to access your sites from another machine (or device) on your local network. So, if your machine’s local IP address (not your public IP address), is `192.168.1.10`, the URL for a site might be `http://client1.192.168.1.10.xip.io`. You can find your local IP address in your network preferences.

`Xip.io` is offered for free by Basecamp and provides one of the simplest services on the internet. They run a simple DNS server that redirects all traffic to `*.xip.io` back to the IP address indicated by the subdomain.

Now you don’t need to update config files every time you add a new site. Simply add the necessary folders to your “sites” directory, and the site will work locally with its own subdomain.
```
<Directory "/www">
  Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
  AllowOverride All
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
</Directory>
